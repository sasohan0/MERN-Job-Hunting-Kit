# Plug & Play Resume System (Master Resume → Tailored Resume)

This is the system used by strong candidates to apply fast without losing quality.

## Step 0: Build a “Master Resume”
One master file with everything:
- ALL projects (6–10)
- ALL bullets
- ALL skills you truly have
- ALL achievements

## Step 1: Create Role Tracks (Templates)
Make 2–3 templates from your master:
- React/Frontend Template
- MERN Full Stack Template
- (Optional) Node/Backend Template

## Step 2: Use Analyze‑5 (From Resume Makeover)
1) Collect 5 job descriptions (same role).
2) Highlight repeated keywords.
3) Those overlaps become your:
- Summary themes
- Skills list
- Top project bullets

## Step 3: Tailor in 8 minutes (per JD)
- Replace target title with JD title
- Update summary keywords (keep it truthful)
- Reorder skills (top 10 matches first)
- Swap in the most relevant 2–3 projects
- Rewrite top bullets to match JD language

## Step 4: Final ATS safety check
- Simple fonts, no complex columns/graphics
- Standard headings
- Consistent dates and spacing
- PDF + DOCX both ready

## Tip: Use AI without risking trust
Use the prompt: `07-AI-HUB/MASTER_PROMPTS.md → JD Tailoring`
