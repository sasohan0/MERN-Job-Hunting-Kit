# AI Hub Overview (Use Responsibly)

AI can help you move faster, but it can also destroy trust if you use it carelessly.
Use AI for **drafts + structure**, not for inventing achievements.

## ✅ Safe Usage Rules
- ✅ AI can: rewrite, summarize, tailor, format, generate templates, create checklists.
- ❌ AI must NOT: fabricate metrics, fake experience, claim tools you never used.
- ✅ Always: review line-by-line, make it sound like you, ensure it is true.

## Best workflow (recommended)
1) Start with your real raw content (projects + responsibilities + proof).
2) Use AI to structure (impact bullets, summaries, JD keyword alignment).
3) Human edit (voice + truth + clarity).
4) Final proofread (grammar + ATS formatting).
