# Professional Photo Guide (Optional)

A real, clean photo is best. If you use AI, use it carefully and keep it realistic.

## Minimum standard (non‑AI)
- Plain background, good lighting
- Clear face, no heavy filters
- Professional dress, friendly expression
- Crop: head + shoulders

## AI headshot prompt (last resort)
Use your real photo as reference in your chosen tool.
Prompt (edit):
“Create a realistic professional headshot of the same person. Studio lighting, neutral background, business casual, natural skin texture, sharp focus, no beauty-filter look, LinkedIn style.”

## Don’ts
- Don’t change your face heavily
- Don’t create fake identity photos
- Don’t use cartoon/anime styles
