# LinkedIn Job Search Playbook (MERN Stack Developers)
_Last updated: 2026-02-07_

This playbook is designed for **MERN / React / Frontend / Full‑Stack developers** targeting **Bangladesh onsite roles + global remote roles**.  
It combines standard LinkedIn methods with practical “edge” tactics that are **ethical** and **execution-focused**.

---

## 0) How LinkedIn Hiring Works (3 Pipelines)
Most candidates only use the **Jobs tab**. Winners run **3 pipelines in parallel**:

1) **Job Postings (Jobs tab)** — high volume, high competition  
2) **Hidden Jobs (Posts)** — recruiters/managers hiring without formal listings  
3) **Warm Access** — referrals + direct outreach to hiring teams

**Rule:** If you’re applying to a crowded posting, pair it with **outreach** (Pipeline #2/#3).

---

## 1) Profile Setup for Recruiter Search (SEO)
Recruiters search by **keywords + titles**. Your job is to match the language of the market (truthfully).

### 1.1 Headline (role + stack + proof)
**Format:** `Target Role | Stack | Proof / Signal`  
Examples:
- `React Developer | Next.js • Tailwind • REST APIs | Built 5+ production apps`
- `MERN Stack Developer | Node.js • MongoDB • Express | E‑commerce & dashboards`

### 1.2 About (7–10 lines, proof-first)
Include:
- Who you are (target role)
- What you build (2 lines)
- Proof links (portfolio + GitHub + best project)
- Remote-ready signals (timezone/overlap, async, documentation-first)

### 1.3 Featured (pin your proof)
Pin **3 items**:
1) Best project (live + GitHub)
2) Portfolio website
3) 1 short case study (problem → solution → impact) OR resume PDF

### 1.4 Skills (25–40, pin top 3)
Pin your top 3 skills that match the roles you want.  
Recommended skills for MERN:
- React, Next.js, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, REST API, JWT, Tailwind CSS  
Optional if true:
- TypeScript, Testing, CI/CD, Docker (only if you can explain)

### 1.5 Experience (projects count)
If you lack full-time roles, list:
- **Projects as experience** (clearly labeled)
- **Internships / freelance / volunteering**

Use bullets in **Impact → Action** format (avoid duty lists).

---

## 2) Job Discovery Strategy (Where the best roles hide)
### 2.1 Jobs Tab (standard, but optimized)
Filters:
- **Date posted:** Past 24 hours / Past week
- **Remote/Hybrid**
- **Experience level:** Internship/Entry/Associate (if applicable)

Create alerts for 3 searches:
- React / Frontend (Bangladesh)
- React / Frontend (Remote)
- MERN / Full‑Stack (Bangladesh + Remote)

**Rule:** Apply early (ideally within 24–96 hours).

### 2.2 “Fresh Jobs” URL time hack (edge tactic)
LinkedIn job URL often includes a time filter like:
- `f_TPR=r86400` (past 24h)

Change to:
- `f_TPR=r3600` (past 1h)
- `f_TPR=r10800` (past 3h)

**Why it helps:** you see newer jobs with fewer applicants.  
**Note:** LinkedIn can change URL structures, so treat this as a tactic, not a guarantee.

### 2.3 Hidden jobs via main Search Bar (Posts)
Most hiring happens through posts like:
- “We’re hiring”
- “Looking for a React developer”
- “Open roles”

**How:**
1) Use LinkedIn main search bar
2) Search → click **Posts**
3) Sort by **Latest**
4) Apply + message the poster

Copy/paste searches:
- `hiring react developer remote`
- `we're hiring frontend developer`
- `"React Developer" AND hiring AND (remote OR Bangladesh)`
- `("MERN" OR "Node.js" OR "Next.js") AND hiring AND (remote OR Bangladesh)`
- `looking for react developer`

---

## 3) Boolean Search Templates (Copy/Paste)
Use in Jobs search and main search.

### 3.1 MERN / Full‑Stack
- `("MERN" OR "Full Stack Developer") AND (Node OR Express OR MongoDB)`
- `("Full Stack Developer" OR MERN) AND (React OR Next.js)`

### 3.2 Frontend (Junior-friendly)
- `("React Developer" OR "Frontend Developer" OR "JavaScript Developer") AND (React OR Next.js OR Tailwind)`
- `("Frontend Engineer" OR "Software Engineer") AND React AND (Junior OR Entry)`

### 3.3 Remote Global
- `("React Developer" OR "Frontend Developer") AND remote`
- `("Full Stack Developer" OR MERN) AND remote`
- `("Next.js" OR "React") AND (remote OR distributed OR async)`

### 3.4 Exclusions (reduce noise)
- `React Developer NOT (senior OR lead OR principal)`
- `Node.js NOT (blockchain OR web3)` *(only if you don’t want these)*

---

## 4) Company-First Strategy (Less noise, higher quality)
### 4.1 Build a target list (30–50 companies)
Include:
- Local product companies
- Agencies hiring juniors
- Remote-friendly startups

### 4.2 Follow + monitor
- Follow the company page
- Check jobs weekly
- Watch hiring manager activity

### 4.3 Find the hiring team (People tab)
Search:
- `Recruiter at Company`
- `Engineering Manager at Company`
- `Frontend Lead at Company`

Then:
- Check their recent posts
- Message if relevant

---

## 5) Apply System (Speed + Quality)
### 5.1 The 30-minute application workflow
1) **JD scan (3 min):** top skills + responsibilities + keywords  
2) **Resume tweak (10 min):** title + summary + skills + 2 bullets  
3) **Project alignment (5 min):** choose 1–2 matching projects  
4) **Short cover note (5 min):** 4–6 lines max  
5) **Submit + track (2 min)**  
6) **Follow-up plan (scheduled)**

### 5.2 The “Proof Pack” (required)
Every application should include:
- Tailored resume (ATS-safe)
- Portfolio link
- GitHub link
- Best project live link

Optional:
- 60–90s Loom demo of best project

---

## 6) Outreach Templates (Copy/Paste)
### 6.1 Connection request (short)
> Hi [Name], I’m a MERN/React developer focused on [type: dashboards/ecommerce]. I noticed you work with/hire for [team/company]. I’d love to connect and follow your updates.

### 6.2 After connecting (proof-first)
> Thanks for connecting, [Name]. I’m targeting React/Frontend roles. Portfolio: [link]. Strongest project: [1‑line proof]. If you’re hiring or know someone who is, I’d appreciate any direction.

### 6.3 Message under a hiring post (direct)
> Hi [Name], I saw your post for [role]. I’m a React/MERN developer with projects in [stack]. Portfolio: [link] | GitHub: [link] | Best project: [link]. Open to a quick screening this week.

### 6.4 Follow-up cadence
- Follow-up 1: Day 2–3  
- Follow-up 2: Day 6–7 (final polite follow-up)

---

## 7) Tracking (Non‑negotiable)
Copy into Google Sheets:

| Date | Company | Role | Remote/Onsite | Source (Jobs/Posts/Referral) | Job Link | Contact | Resume Version | Portfolio | Status | Next Action | Follow-up Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Weekly review (15 minutes):**
- Which source produced interviews?
- Which roles reject fast?
- What keyword gap repeats?
- What one asset to improve next week?

---

## 8) AI Assist (Use smartly, keep it human)
AI is best for **first drafts** and **rewriting**. You must edit for truth + voice.

### 8.1 Master prompt: Resume tailor (ATS-safe)
> You are an ATS-focused resume editor.  
> Here is my resume: [paste]  
> Here is the JD: [paste]  
> Tasks:  
> 1) Extract top keywords + responsibilities.  
> 2) Rewrite Summary (3–4 lines) aligned to JD.  
> 3) Rewrite 4 bullets using Impact → Action → Tech (no fake metrics).  
> 4) Suggest 2 matching projects + rewrite their bullets.  
> Constraints: no fake claims, no keyword stuffing, keep concise.

### 8.2 Master prompt: Recruiter message (short)
> Write 2 LinkedIn messages (under 500 characters) to a recruiter for [role].  
> My proof: [portfolio], [best project], [stack].  
> Tone: confident, simple, human. No cringe.

### 8.3 Master prompt: Follow‑up pack
> Create a follow‑up pack for this application:  
> - 2 LinkedIn DMs  
> - 2 emails (Day 3, Day 7)  
> - 1 final close-the-loop message  
> Proof-first. No fluff.  
> Role + JD: [paste]  
> My best proof links: [paste]

---

## 9) Weekly Plan (Sustainable execution)
- **Applications:** 15–25/week (quality only)
- **Outreach:** 7–10/week (proof-based)
- **Content:** 2 proof posts/week (project progress, demo, case study)
- **Assets:** 1 improvement/week (portfolio/README/resume bullets)
- **Practice:** 2 mock interviews/week (behavioral + technical)

---

## 10) Common Mistakes (avoid)
- Generic title (“Web Developer”) with no stack
- No proof links (portfolio/GitHub)
- Applying without tailoring
- Spamming DMs
- Inconsistent execution (no tracker)

---

### Quick Success Rule
**Every day:** Apply + Outreach + Improve 1 asset.  
Consistency beats intensity.
