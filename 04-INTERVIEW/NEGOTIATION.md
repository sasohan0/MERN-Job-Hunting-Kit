# Salary Negotiation Basics (Entry to Mid Level)

## Principles
- Never negotiate without value proof (projects, internship, results)
- Ask for range, not exact number
- Be polite + firm

## Script
“Thanks for the offer. I’m excited about the role. Based on the responsibilities and market range, is there flexibility to adjust to <X–Y>? I can start immediately and I’m confident I can deliver <proof>.”

## If they say no
“Understood. Can we review after 3 months based on performance? Also, can we discuss learning budget / performance bonus / remote equipment support?”
