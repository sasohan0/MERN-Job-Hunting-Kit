# Technical Interview Answering System (MERN/React)

## Rule: Think out loud
Interviewers evaluate your thinking, not only the final answer.

## Structure for any technical question
1) Clarify requirements (inputs/outputs, constraints)  
2) Propose approach (simple first)  
3) Analyze complexity (Big-O)  
4) Code + explain  
5) Edge cases + tests

## Example: “Remove duplicates from array”
Approach: Set / map  
Explain complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space

## Mindset
- Don’t panic on unknowns
- Ask clarifying questions
- Offer tradeoffs (simple vs optimized)
