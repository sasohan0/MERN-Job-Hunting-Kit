# Interpersonal Interview Questions — Frameworks + Examples

## 1) “Tell me about yourself” (Present → Past → Future)
**Present:** who you are now (role + stack)  
**Past:** 1–2 proofs (projects, internship, achievements)  
**Future:** why this role/company + what you will deliver

**Example (React dev):**  
“I’m a React developer who builds responsive UI and integrates APIs. Recently I built <Project> with auth, dashboard, and payments. I enjoy turning requirements into clean user flows. Now I’m looking for a frontend role where I can ship features fast and collaborate with a product team.”

## 2) Strengths (Proof-based)
Structure: Strength → proof → relevance to role

## 3) Weakness
Weakness → what you do now → result (no drama)

## 4) Conflict / teamwork
Use STAR: Situation → Task → Action → Result

## 5) Why should we hire you?
3 bullets: proof + fit + attitude
