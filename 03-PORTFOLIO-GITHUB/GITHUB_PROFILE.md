# GitHub Profile Optimization

## Profile setup
- [ ] Clean profile photo + short bio (role + stack)
- [ ] Add email + portfolio link (public safe)
- [ ] Create a **Profile README** repo (username/username) and add an intro + proofs
- [ ] Pin 4–6 best repos (not unfinished)
- [ ] Ensure each pinned repo has a strong README

## What to pin (recommended)
1) Best full-stack MERN project  
2) Best frontend UI project  
3) One API/backend project  
4) One small clean utility project (shows fundamentals)  
5) (Optional) Open-source contribution / fork with PRs

## Activity
Consistency matters. Improve your own repos + docs if you can’t code daily.
