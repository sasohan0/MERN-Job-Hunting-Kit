# Project Quality Checklist (What Recruiters Actually Want)

## Every “job-ready” project should have
- [ ] Real problem scenario (not generic)
- [ ] Authentication (if relevant) + role-based access (bonus)
- [ ] CRUD + validation + error handling
- [ ] Clean UI (responsive)
- [ ] Deployed live + working
- [ ] README with setup + features + screenshots
- [ ] At least 1 advanced feature:
  - Payments, file upload, search + filters, charts, admin dashboard, caching, tests

## Proof style
- [ ] Add “Impact” bullets (e.g., optimized load time, reduced API calls, better UX)
