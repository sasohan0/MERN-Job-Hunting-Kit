# Referrals & Alumni Network

Referrals reduce competition because you enter with trust.

## Simple system
- [ ] Make a list of 30 people: alumni, seniors, mentors, friends
- [ ] Message 5/week (short + proof)
- [ ] Ask for 10 minutes advice, not “job”

## Message template
“Hi <Name>, I’m applying for <Role>. I built <Project> (link).  
Could you share any feedback or refer me if your team is hiring?”
