# Bangladesh Job Portals (Channel Support)

Use these as additional channels, especially for local roles and internships.  
Best practice: **apply + then follow-up on LinkedIn** when possible.

## Recommended portals (Bangladesh)
- **Bdjobs** — largest local portal: https://bdjobs.com/h/
- **ATB Jobs** — tech-friendly listings: https://atb-jobs.com
- **Company career pages** — highest quality if you target specific companies

## Secondary portals (use selectively)
- Other local portals (varies by role and quality)
- Facebook groups (Channel 3) for internships/junior roles

## How to win on job portals (execution checklist)
- [ ] Profile 100% complete (education, skills, preferred roles)
- [ ] Role title matches target (avoid generic “Web Developer”)
- [ ] Keyword alignment: React / Next.js / Node / MongoDB / REST / JWT / Tailwind (as applicable)
- [ ] Apply early (within 24–48 hours)
- [ ] Keep one “portal resume” ATS-safe (simple formatting)
- [ ] Track every application + follow-up date

## Fast follow-up (recommended)
If you can find a recruiter/hiring manager on LinkedIn:
- Send a **3-line proof message** with portfolio + best project link.
