# Remote Job Hunting Strategies (Global Remote + Bangladesh)

Remote hiring rewards candidates who are:
- **Reliable** (clear communication, consistent execution)
- **Documented** (proof, README, demos)
- **Fast to evaluate** (easy links, easy story)

---

## 1) Build a remote-ready “Proof Pack”
Minimum:
- Portfolio (2–4 best projects)
- GitHub (pinned repos + strong READMEs)
- Tailored resume (ATS-safe)
Bonus:
- 60–90s Loom demo for your best project
- 1-page “Work Samples” doc (screenshots + links)

---

## 2) Write remote signals everywhere (tiny detail, big impact)
Add these to resume/LinkedIn/cover letter:
- Timezone: UTC+6 (Bangladesh)
- Overlap hours: “Available 3–4 hours overlap with EU/US”
- Work style: async updates, documentation-first
- Tools: GitHub, Jira/Trello, Slack/Discord, Notion, Loom

---

## 3) Remote sourcing mix (what works)
- Remote boards (curated) + early applications
- LinkedIn remote roles + outreach
- Communities (Reddit, Discord, Slack) + reputation
- Referrals + alumni network
- Open-source contributions (visibility)

---

## 4) Execution plan (weekly)
- 15–20 applications/week (quality)
- 7–10 outreach messages/week (short proof-based)
- 2 proof posts/week (LinkedIn)
- 1 portfolio improvement/week (new case study or README)

---

## 5) Remote interview expectations (prepare for this)
- Clear speaking + structured answers (STAR / PREP / 3-part)
- Screen sharing confidence
- Written updates: “daily summary” style
- Reliability cues: “here’s what I shipped” + “here’s the doc”

---

## 6) Anti-scam & safety rules
- No upfront payments for “getting hired”
- Verify company identity + domain email
- Avoid sharing sensitive documents early
- Use escrow for freelance if possible

---

## 7) If you’re early-career (reality + strategy)
Sometimes the fastest path is:
Internship → first proof → upgrade role/salary.
Focus on building **credible proof** quickly.
