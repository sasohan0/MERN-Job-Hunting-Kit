# LinkedIn Job Search Strategies (Bangladesh + Global Remote)

LinkedIn is a **high-ROI channel** when you do two things consistently:
1) **Make your profile searchable** (recruiter SEO)  
2) **Apply + outreach** with proof, early, every week

---

## 1) Profile SEO (so recruiters find you)
**Headline (220 chars max):**
- Target role + stack + proof signal  
Example: `React / MERN Developer | Built 5+ production-grade apps | Next.js • Node.js • MongoDB`

**About (7–10 lines):**
- Proof-first: what you built, for whom, what result, what stack
- Add 2 links (portfolio + best project)

**Featured:**
- Best project (live + repo)
- Resume PDF (optional)
- Portfolio case study

**Skills:**
- Add 25–40 relevant skills
- Pin top 3 skills that match target role

**Experience:**
- Treat projects as experience if needed (clearly labeled)
- Bullet format: Impact → Action (no duty lists)

---

## 2) Search like a recruiter (job search patterns)
Use combinations:
- `React Developer` + `Next.js` / `Tailwind`
- `Frontend Developer` + `JavaScript` / `TypeScript`
- `MERN` + `Node` + `MongoDB`
- `Remote` + `React`

Filters:
- Remote / Hybrid
- Date posted (Past 24 hours / Past week)
- Experience level (Intern/Entry/Associate)

**Rule:** apply within **24 hours** whenever possible.

---

## 3) Save searches + alerts (non‑negotiable)
Create 3 saved searches:
1) React/Frontend (Bangladesh)
2) React Remote (Global)
3) MERN/Full Stack Remote

Turn on daily alerts. Then make it a habit:
- **20 minutes morning**: new postings + apply
- **20 minutes evening**: follow-ups + outreach

---

## 4) Apply with a “Proof Pack” (minimum)
Every application should have:
- Resume (tailored)
- Portfolio link
- GitHub link
- Best project link (live)

Optional: 60–90s Loom demo video of your best project.

---

## 5) Outreach = multiplier (keep it short)
After applying, message recruiter/hiring manager (if available):

**Template A (Recruiter):**
Hi <Name>, I applied for <Role>. I’m a React/MERN dev and built <Project> with <proof>.  
Links: <Portfolio> | <GitHub> | <Project>.  
Would love 10 minutes of feedback on fit.

**Template B (Hiring manager):**
Hi <Name>, quick note after applying to <Role>.  
I shipped <feature/proof> using <stack>. Here’s the demo: <link>.  
Open to a short screening this week.

**Follow-up cadence:**
- Day 2–3: 1st follow-up
- Day 6–7: final follow-up (polite)

---

## 6) Content strategy (2 posts/week) — proof posts only
Post ideas:
- Feature demo (GIF/screenshot) + what you learned
- Short case study: problem → solution → stack → result
- “Build in public” updates (weekly)

**Do not** post generic motivational content without proof.

---

## 7) Build a targeted company list (fastest path to interviews)
Make a list of 30–50 companies:
- Bangladesh + global remote-friendly startups
Then weekly:
- Check career page
- Apply
- Outreach
- Track

---

## 8) Common mistakes to avoid
- Generic branding (“Web Developer”)
- No proof links
- No tailoring
- Spamming DMs
- Inconsistent posting/applying
