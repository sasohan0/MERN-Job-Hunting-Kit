# LinkedIn (Level 2) — Apply + Outreach System

## Core rules
- Apply to roles that match your stack (React/MERN) — don't spray and pray.
- Use keywords from the JD in your headline/about/skills (only if true).
- Outreach is your multiplier (but keep it short).

## Weekly system
- [ ] 30 targeted applications/week (minimum)
- [ ] 15 outreach messages/week (short + proof)
- [ ] 2 posts/week (build visible credibility)

## Profile essentials
- Headline: target role + stack + proof (e.g., “React Developer | Built X | Open to Remote”)
- About: 6–10 lines, proof-first (projects, metrics, tools)
- Featured: best project, best case study, resume
- Skills: top 15–30 relevant skills (hard skills first)

## Outreach template (DM)
“Hi <Name>, I’m a React/MERN dev. I built <Project> with <Proof>.  
If you’re hiring for <Role>, may I share my resume + project links?”
