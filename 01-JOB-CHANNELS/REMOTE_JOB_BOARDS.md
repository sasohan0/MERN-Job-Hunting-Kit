# International Remote Job Boards (Global Remote)

Remote boards can unlock global roles, but competition is high—your **proof pack** must be clean:
- Resume (tailored) + Portfolio + GitHub (pinned) + 1–2 best project demos

## Core remote boards (start here)
- **We Work Remotely** — strong for engineering roles
- **Remote OK** — high volume, check legitimacy
- **Wellfound** — startup jobs (strong for early-to-mid)
- **Dynamite Jobs** — curated remote roles
- **Jobspresso** — smaller but quality
- **FlexJobs** — curated (paid)

## Additional sources (also useful)
- **Glassdoor** — remote roles + company research + salary insights
- **Company career pages** — best signal-to-noise if you target 20–40 companies
- **Recruiter outreach** — remote recruiters / agency recruiters (industry-specific)

## How to win on remote boards (execution checklist)
- [ ] Apply within **24 hours** of posting (time advantage)
- [ ] Tailor 3 things (8–12 min): **Target title, Summary keywords, Project bullets**
- [ ] Include “remote-ready” signals: timezone (UTC+6), overlap hours, async communication
- [ ] Attach proof links (portfolio + GitHub + best project)
- [ ] Follow-up after 48–72 hours with a short proof-based message (if contact exists)

## Anti-scam safety rules (remote)
- [ ] No “pay to get hired”
- [ ] Verify company on LinkedIn + website
- [ ] Avoid sending NID/passport/banking before official offer & contract
- [ ] Prefer email addresses on company domain
