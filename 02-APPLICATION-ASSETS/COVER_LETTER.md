# Cover Letter Templates (Short + Effective)

## Rule
A cover letter is not a story. It’s **a bridge** between JD and your proof.

## Template (email-style cover letter)
Subject: <Role> Application — <Your Name>

Dear <Hiring Manager>,
I’m applying for <Role>. I’m a <React/MERN> developer and recently built <Project> that includes <relevant proof>.  
I can contribute by <1–2 deliverables aligned to JD>.

Links: Resume <link> | Portfolio <link> | GitHub <link> | Best Project <link>

Thank you for your time.  
Regards, <Name>, <Phone>

## When to use
- Direct Apply
- Email applications
