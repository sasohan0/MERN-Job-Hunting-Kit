# Resume Checklist (ATS + Human) — MERN/React Developers

## Fundamentals (must match)
- [ ] Resume reads like a **marketing doc**, not autobiography
- [ ] Targeted to **one role** (React/Frontend/MERN)
- [ ] Concise (every word earns its spot)
- [ ] Career story makes sense (no confusion)

## Header
- [ ] Name, phone, email, city
- [ ] LinkedIn + GitHub + Portfolio links (working)
- [ ] Target title under your name (matches JD wording)

## Summary (3–4 lines, paragraph)
- [ ] Who you are + target role
- [ ] 2–3 strongest proofs (projects/impact/stack)
- [ ] Tools/stack aligned to JD keywords

## Key Skills (9–15)
- [ ] Skills pulled from 5 JDs (Analyze 5)
- [ ] Top skill placed first (top-left if formatted in columns)
- [ ] Hard skills first (React, Next, Node, MongoDB, REST, JWT, etc.)

## Experience / Projects bullets (Impact → Action)
Use this formula:
- **Impact/result** + what you did + tools (if relevant)

Example:
- [ ] “Improved page load by 35% by optimizing API calls and implementing caching in Node.js.”

## ATS safety
- [ ] Standard headings (Summary, Skills, Experience, Projects, Education)
- [ ] No tables/graphics that break parsing
- [ ] Consistent dates and formatting
- [ ] Proofread (typos kill trust)

## Final checks
- [ ] Read out loud (clarity)
- [ ] Remove clutter (irrelevant)
- [ ] Ask 3 reviewers (grammar, recruiter/HR, hiring manager)
