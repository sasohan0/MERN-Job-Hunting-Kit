# Tailor Resume to a Job Description (JD) — 4 Steps

## Step 1: Highlight JD requirements
- [ ] Tools (React, Next.js, Tailwind, Node, MongoDB)
- [ ] Responsibilities (build UI, integrate APIs, testing)
- [ ] Soft skills (communication, teamwork) — only if you can prove

## Step 2: Update “Target Title”
Use the same wording as the JD (if honest).

## Step 3: Update Summary + Skills
- [ ] Summary: make the fit obvious in 10 seconds
- [ ] Skills: add missing relevant skills (only if true)

## Step 4: Remove irrelevant items
- [ ] Remove unrelated projects/bullets to reduce noise
- [ ] Replace with more relevant proof

## Optional: “Analyze 5” method
Collect 5 similar JDs → find repeated keywords → make them your resume themes.
