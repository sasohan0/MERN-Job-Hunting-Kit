# JD Tailoring System (Fast + Accurate)

Goal: tailor in **8–12 minutes** per job without rewriting your whole resume.

---

## Inputs you need
- Your **Master Resume** (everything you’ve done)
- Job Description (JD)
- 1–2 projects that match the JD best

---

## Step-by-step (8–12 minutes)
### 1) Extract the top requirements (2 minutes)
From the JD, list:
- 5 must-have skills/tools
- 3 responsibilities
- 2 proof signals (portfolio, tests, communication, etc.)

### 2) Update target title (30 seconds)
Under your name:
- Use JD wording **if true**
Example: “Frontend Developer (React)” / “MERN Stack Developer”

### 3) Rewrite Summary keywords (2 minutes)
Keep it 3–4 lines paragraph.
- Line 1: who you are + years/projects
- Line 2: stack + domain proof
- Line 3: results + work style (remote-ready if needed)

### 4) Reorder Skills (1 minute)
Put the most important JD skills first (top-left first, top 10 most relevant).

### 5) Swap Projects (2 minutes)
Pick 2–3 projects that match the JD.
For each project, ensure:
- role-aligned features
- deployed link
- repo link
- 2–3 bullets aligned to JD

### 6) Rewrite top bullets (2–3 minutes)
Use Impact → Action format (no duty lists).

**Impact → Action formula:**
Result/impact + what you did + tools/method

Examples:
- “Reduced API response time by 30% by optimizing MongoDB queries and adding indexes.”
- “Improved UX completion rate by rebuilding checkout flow using React Hook Form + validation.”

### 7) Remove clutter (1 minute)
Delete irrelevant skills/bullets so the resume “looks like the JD”.
