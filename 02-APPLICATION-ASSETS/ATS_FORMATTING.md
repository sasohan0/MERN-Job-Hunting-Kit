# ATS Formatting Rules (Do this to avoid getting filtered)

## Must do
- Use standard headings: Summary, Skills, Experience, Projects, Education
- Keep fonts simple (Arial/Calibri)
- Use consistent date format (MMM YYYY – MMM YYYY)
- Use bullets for achievements
- Save as PDF (and keep DOCX too)

## Avoid
- Graphics, icons, fancy columns for online portals
- Headers/footers that hide content
- Tables that break parsing
- Keyword stuffing (reads fake)

## Proofread checklist
- Read out loud
- Spellcheck
- Check spacing and font consistency
